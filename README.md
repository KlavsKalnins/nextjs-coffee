What is your project named? anything-you-want
Would you like to use TypeScript? YES
Would you like to use ESLint? YES  (I would use a vs code extension than dirtying code if solo dev)
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? YES
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No
Would you like to use App Router? NO - the old one is a bit easier to learn first
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No

cd anything-you-want
npm install
npm run dev

(IF YOU GOT ANY ERRORS THEN READ THE CONSOLE AND USE GOOGLE)
